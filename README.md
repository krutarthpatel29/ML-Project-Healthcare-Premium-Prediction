# 🏥 Health Insurance Premium Predictor

An intelligent and interactive web application built with **Streamlit** that predicts individual health insurance premiums using machine learning models. It analyzes user inputs like age, BMI, smoking status, income, and more to estimate the expected premium. A dual-model strategy ensures higher prediction accuracy by tailoring the algorithm to the user’s age group.

## 📊 Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Dataset**  
   - Public dataset with demographic and health-related features used to estimate insurance costs.

2. **EDA & Feature Engineering**  
   - Distribution analysis, correlation checks  
   - Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables

3. **Model Building & Selection**  
   - Trained multiple ML algorithms (Linear Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest)  
   - Selected the best models based on RMSE, MAE  
   - Applied segmentation:
     - Age ≤ 25 → Linear Regression
     - Age > 25 → XGBoost

4. **Model Deployment**  
   - Serialized models and scalers using `joblib`  
   - Integrated with Streamlit for real-time prediction
